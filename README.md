# XiangJu
Xiangju is an android app aimed at location sharing and guiding. User can create an account by e-mail. After the confirmation of the e-mail address, user can login with it. Users logged in with same account can share their location, which is marked as gps point on a map. By clicking on a point, user can get the route to that point.  
The main feature of this app is its simplicity. Also, it is its simplicity that makes it easy to use.   
This app is developed by me and my teamate. For the sake of copyright, I only put the server part here.
